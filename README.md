 flutter php mysql app student profile management

This is a Flutter app that connects to a PHP backend and a MySQL database to manage student profiles. The app allows users to perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on student data, such as name, email, phone number, and profile picture. The app also uses Firebase authentication to enable user login and registration. The app demonstrates how to use Flutter widgets, state management, HTTP requests, image picker, and Firebase services. The repository also includes the PHP scripts and SQL queries to set up the backend and the database. This project showcases my skills in Flutter development, PHP programming, MySQL database management, and Firebase integration.
